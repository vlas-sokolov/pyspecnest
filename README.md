# pyspecnest
This repository provides a framework for nested sampling of the [pyspeckit](https://github.com/pyspeckit/pyspeckit) spectral models with MultiNest (via [PyMultiNest](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest)).

You can clone and install `pyspecnest` locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlas-sokolov/pyspecnest.git
cd pyspecnest
pip install .
```

Was used for [this](https://github.com/vlas-sokolov/bayesian-ngc1333), which containes a rather more detailed example of the usage.
